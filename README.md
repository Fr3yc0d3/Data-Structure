# Data-Structure
> i'm making this's DS repo as my personal Assignment so i can revise my theory and prepare myself for interview 
A Data Structure organizes related data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently 


There are different types of DS's for different types of applications and work and there are also some for only some highly specialized to specific tasks.
same as we use graph and bars for represent anything so we can explain otheres **Trees** are used to represent hierarchical data, such as file and folder in filesystem and **Queues** can be used to create task schedulers, compiler implementations usually use **Hash tables** to look out identifires as same as that **Binary Tree** are used in searching algorithms.

```
Usually choosing the correct Data structure is the key to designing an efficient algorithm.
